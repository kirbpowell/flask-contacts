# Flask Contacts

This is a pretty basic contacts web app I built using Flask. I originally built it during an interview process that didn't end up panning out, but I thought it was a cool little project and I wanted to keep it in the cloud in case I ever have time to get it running a bit more self sufficiently. 

# Future Work

* I'd love to get the 'Edit' and 'Save' buttons working properly
* Would also love to get everything running locally - either by rigging up my own REST endpoints to grab JSON data from, or by sticking things into a database
